                                <li>His early departure later causes a sharp dispute between Paul and Barnabas: "Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark... But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia" (Acts 15:37-38)</li>
                                <li>Historical context: Perga was in a malaria-infested region, and the journey ahead involved crossing the dangerous Taurus Mountains—possibly contributing factors to Mark's departure</li>

                                <li>Paul and Barnabas boldly declare: "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you reject it... we turn to the Gentiles" (Acts 13:46)</li>

                                <li>"Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord" (Acts 14:3)</li>
                                <li>Paul and Barnabas perform <strong>miraculous signs and wonders</strong>: "the Lord... was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands" (Acts 14:3)</li>

                                <li>Locals believe <strong>Paul is Hermes</strong> and <strong>Barnabas is Zeus</strong>: "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!" (Acts 14:11)</li>
                                <li>Cultural context: Local legend (recorded by Ovid) told of Zeus and Hermes visiting the region in human form and being rejected by all except one elderly couple</li>
                                <li>"The priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, intending to sacrifice with the multitudes" (Acts 14:13)</li>

                                <li>First recorded sermon to pagans focuses on creation and natural revelation rather than Jewish history</li>
                                <li>Dramatic shift from adoration to <strong>stoning Paul</strong>: "Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead" (Acts 14:19)</li>
                                <li>Paul miraculously recovers: "However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city" (Acts 14:20)</li>
                                <li>Timothy's hometown: Paul likely met Timothy's family here (Acts 16:1-3)</li>

                                <li>"And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe" (Acts 14:20)</li>
                                <li>Made <strong>many disciples</strong>: "And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples" (Acts 14:21)</li>
                                <li>No specific opposition recorded—a peaceful ministry after intense persecution</li>
                                <li>Gaius, a later companion of Paul, was from Derbe (Acts 20:4)</li>
                                <li>Archaeological note: Derbe was the easternmost point of their journey, located in the Roman province of Galatia</li>
                                <li>Considered a successful and tranquil segment of the journey</li>

                                <li>"Strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, 'We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God'" (Acts 14:22)</li>
                                <li><strong>Appointed elders</strong>: "So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed" (Acts 14:23)</li>
                                <li>Cultural context: The Greek term for "appointed" (χειροτονήσαντες) literally means "to stretch out the hand" and was used for voting by show of hands—suggesting possible congregational involvement</li>
                                <li>"After they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia" (Acts 14:24-25)</li>
                                <li>Final return to Antioch (Syria): "From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed" (Acts 14:26)</li>
                                <li>Reported back: "Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles" (Acts 14:27)</li>
                                <li>"So they stayed there a long time with the disciples" (Acts 14:28)</li>

                        <p>Paul's First Missionary Journey marked a <strong>groundbreaking phase</strong> in Christian history — the Gospel broke beyond Jewish boundaries and took root among the Gentiles, fulfilling Jesus's words that "this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations" (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>With Spirit-led boldness, signs and wonders, sound doctrine, and pastoral care, Paul and Barnabas laid the foundation for the global mission of the Church, demonstrating that "the word of God grew and multiplied" (Acts 12:24) despite opposition.</p>
