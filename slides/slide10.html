            <ul>

                <li>First recorded sermon to pagans focuses on creation and natural revelation rather than Jewish history</li>
                <li>Dramatic shift from adoration to <strong>stoning Paul</strong>: "And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead" (Acts 14:19)</li>
                <li>Paul miraculously recovers: "Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city" (Acts 14:20)</li>
                <li>Timothy's hometown: Paul likely met Timothy's family here (Acts 16:1-3)</li>
