            <ul>
                <li>"Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem" (Acts 13:13)</li>
                <li>His early departure later causes a sharp dispute between Paul and Barnabas: "And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work" (Acts 15:37-38)</li>
                <li>Historical context: Perga was in a malaria-infested region, and the journey ahead involved crossing the dangerous Taurus Mountainsâ€”possibly contributing factors to Mark's departure</li>
                <li>Later reconciliation: Mark eventually regained Paul's trust, becoming "profitable to me for the ministry" (2 Timothy 4:11)</li>
