        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion-text">
            <p>Paul's First Missionary Journey marked a <strong>groundbreaking phase</strong> in Christian history â€” the Gospel broke beyond Jewish boundaries and took root among the Gentiles, fulfilling Jesus's words that "this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations" (Matthew 24:14).</p>
            <p>With Spirit-led boldness, signs and wonders, sound doctrine, and pastoral care, Paul and Barnabas laid the foundation for the global mission of the Church, demonstrating that "the word of God grew and multiplied" (Acts 12:24) despite opposition.</p>
