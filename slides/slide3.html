            <ul>
                <li>The Holy Spirit spoke while believers in Antioch were "ministering to the Lord" (λειτουργούντων) and fasting—a term suggesting formal worship</li>
                <li>"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away" (Acts 13:3)—following ancient Jewish commissioning customs</li>
                <li>Commissioned for missionary service (approx. 46-48 A.D.)</li>
                <li>This marks a pivotal shift in Acts from Peter's ministry to Paul's, and from Jerusalem to the wider Gentile world</li>
                <li>The Greek word for "sent" (ἀπέλυσαν) in Acts 13:3 is the root of our word "apostle"—one who is sent</li>
